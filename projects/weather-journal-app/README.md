# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project Allows the use to know the current weather with three methods: 
* (zipcode) for US only. Ex: "94040"
* (zipcode, [ISO two letter countrycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)). Ex: "94040,US"
* (cityName, [ISO two letter countrycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)). Ex: "Alexandria,EG"

Also we support a bit of responsive design.
